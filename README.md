# Image-and-Video-Caption-Generator
Creating accurate and meaningful captions for images and videos is a difficult task because it requires a deep understanding of what is shown. This difficulty is increased by the specific challenges of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and dealing with the time-related aspects of videos.This guide explores the limitations of traditional RNNs, the vanishing gradient problem, and the challenges associated with CNN-LSTM models in video captioning, providing insights into potential solutions.
