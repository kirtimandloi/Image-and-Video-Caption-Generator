# Image-and-Video-Caption-Generator
Creating accurate and meaningful captions for images and videos is a difficult task because it requires a deep understanding of what is shown. This difficulty is increased by the specific challenges of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and dealing with the time-related aspects of videos.This guide explores the limitations of traditional RNNs, the vanishing gradient problem, and the challenges associated with CNN-LSTM models in video captioning, providing insights into potential solutions.


# Image and Video Caption Generator

## Overview
The main aim of this project is to gain knowledge of deep learning techniques by implementing an image and video caption generator. We primarily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for this purpose. 
The project involves merging these architectures to create a CNN-RNN model for image captioning and further integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced video captioning.

## Components

### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)Purpose: 
Extract features from images.
Model Used: Xception (a pre-trained model).LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)Purpose: Generate descriptions for images using features extracted by the CNN.
### LLM (Large Language Model)Purpose: 
Enhance video captioning by summarizing frame-level captions into a coherent video caption. 
Model Used: Facebook's BART.
### Workflow
#### Image Captioning:Use the Xception model to extract features from the input image.Pass these features to the LSTM network to generate a descriptive caption.
#### Video Captioning:Generate captions for individual video frames using the CNN-LSTM model.Feed the frame-level captions into the BART model.BART performs text summarization on the frame captions to create a concise summary.The summarized text serves as the final caption for the video.

## Benefits
### Coherence: By leveraging the LLM, video captions are more coherent, effectively capturing the essence of the video sequence.
### Conciseness: The LLM condenses multiple frame-level captions into a single, concise summary.
### Informativeness: Enhanced natural language processing capabilities improve the informativeness of video captions, aiding in better video understanding and accessibility.
